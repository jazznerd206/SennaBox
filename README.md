<h2 align="center">The year is 691 BC.</h2>
<p>Sennacherib, King of the Assyrians, has led his last campaign of war, conquering Babylon and bringing riches to his kingdom.  He turned his gaze inward, focused now on growing his wealth and enriching his people with beauty and knowledge.</p>

<h2 align="center"> The Gardens of Nineveh </h2>
<p>Among other spoils of war, plants from far away lands were returned to the capital city of Nineveh. A massive construction project was undertaken, 18 large canals were dug and a massive 65km aqueduct directed life sustaining water from the hills above. The expansion of these gardens continued until the reign of Ashurbanipal II ended around 627 BC. Historians argue that Nineveh is the true location of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.</p>
