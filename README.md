### The year is 691 BC.
Sennacherib, King of the Assyrians, has led his last campaign of war, conquering Babylon and bringing riches to his kingdom. He turned his gaze inward.

### The Gardens of Nineveh
Among other spoils of war, plants from far away lands were returned to the capital city of Nineveh. A massive construction project was undertaken, 18 large canals were dug and a massive 65km aqueduct directed life sustaining water from the hills above. The expansion of these gardens continued until the reign of Ashurbanipal II ended around 627 BC. Some historians argue that Ninevehe is the true historic location of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

# SennaBox
Build your own garden. SennaBox is a no spill, self watering planter box. Plants in the SennaBox take water and nutrients as they need, just keep the reservoir filled and watch your plants thrive. Not all plants are created equally, so SennaBox can create indiviudual watering schedules for each plant. Bring home living remembrances of your travels, the parts of the world that you have conquered.
